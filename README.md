# Puzzle-game

Simple puzzle game implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this game, you can move the numbers around to solve the puzzle

This code creates a 3x3 puzzle game where numbers from 1 to 8 are placed in the puzzle grid initially, and the 9th position is left empty for movements. Clicking on any numbered piece adjacent to the empty space moves it into the empty space.
